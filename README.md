## Analysis 
In the Tableau worksheet above, I have gathered information about New York's Citi Bike program from the month/year of Jan 2021 and Jan 2022. In the information I gathered, I noticed that there was a great jump of bikers in 2022 Jan than there was for Jan 2021. With that being said, the dangers of covid were still very promient in the year 2021 and especially in the month of janurary. With that being said, precautions were taken by many people including bikers, to prevent further infection in a crowded city like New York.

Also when finding the age and gender of bikers, there was an unusual amount of unknown genders for people born in 1969. I thought that was pretty interesting because the data stands out greatly in the dashboard and I do not know why it is that way it is. But none the less, the birth year of 1969 holds the most bikers in the year 2022 and 2021.

All of the start stations/points all clump up into the heart of NY. However, only few end points reach out past the city.
